                        <div className='text'>The ARR Group was founded in the year 1947, by the late Sri.A.R.Ramaswamy, Ex.Member of Legislative assembly, Tamilnadu and Ex. Chairman of Kumbakonam Municipality. It is the Basic Culture, tradition and custom of Tamilians to use Betels with Seeval(Sliced Arecanut/Betelnut) for extending hospitality to the guest  and exchanging the same at auspicious occasions like Betrothals, Marriage etc.,  So our beloved founder selected “SEEVAL (Arecanut slices)” as the first product of this group.  The product which was made manually was thick and less smooth, which restricted the users of Seeval, Later In  1950’s . the operation was modernizes by introducing the electrically driven slicing machines, which was first of its kind. WE ARE THE PIONEERS IN INVESTING THIS ARECANUT SLICING MACHINE which made the product thinner and hence softer for chewing.
